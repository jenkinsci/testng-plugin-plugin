TestNG Plugin for Jenkins (and maybe Hudson)
=============

https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/testng-plugin

This plugin allows you to publish TestNG results. TestNG result xml file
contains more information than the JUnit report xml file. This plugin
exposes those extra information in graph and table reports.

This plugin makes it possible to import TestNG XML reports from each
build into Hudson. The data is parsed using the output generated using
org.testng.reporters.XMLReporter. The results are displayed with a trend
graph and all details about which tests that failed are also presented.
